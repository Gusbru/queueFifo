# queueFifo
Project to simulate a FIFO queue

## How to run
You need an input file (`input.json`) in the JSON format.

The available options are:

- `nServers`: number of servers (in the current 
implementation the number of servers is going to be
the same as the number of queues)
- `nSteps`: number of steps
- `processCreationRate`: 
- `processDestructionRate`:
- `queueInitialLength`:
- `outputLevel`: 0 for debug mode / 1 for normal mode
